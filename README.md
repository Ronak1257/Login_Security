# Login_Security

In my project, I developed a robust login protection system using Servlet and JSP in Java, incorporating automatic session timeout and logout features. Additionally, I implemented functionality to fetch and display user details, including name, address, and mobile number, from the database upon login, with an automatic logout after one minute for added security.
